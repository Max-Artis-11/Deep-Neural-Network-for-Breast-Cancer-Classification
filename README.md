# Neural Network for Breast Cancer Classification

Build and train a neural network with PyTorch to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. This project is part of the IBM Deep Learning with PyTorch course on Coursera: this project walks you through the complete process—from loading data to evaluating a model—using clear, well-commented code. I think its very ideal for those new to PyTorch and neural networks.

## Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)

- 569 samples
- 30 numerical features
- 2 classes: `benign` and `malignant`
